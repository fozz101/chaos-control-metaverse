# Chaos Control Metaverse

# About

Chaos Control is a business Metaverse in which workers, early graduates, and disabled people can have an enjoyable working experience and an easily accessible working space. It also provides Businesses ( like companies, start-ups, etc. ) with an RH scoring system for better tracking of the workers. This solution will reduce all sorts of bills and equipment costs since they won't need to rent/buy a site to work in, use the desktop screens virtually, and interact with the voice chat with all workers.
